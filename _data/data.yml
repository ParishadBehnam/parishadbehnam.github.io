    title: About Me
    summary: |
      My name is Parishad BehnamGhader. I got my B.Sc. degree at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran and I am currently a senior master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the same university and a researcher in <a href="http://mll.ce.sharif.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning Lab</a> in computer engineering department under the supervision of <a href="http://sharif.edu/~soleymani/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Mahdieh Soleymani</a>.
      I am mainly interested in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Graph Representation Learning. More specifically, I currently take advantage of the real-world information of knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance deep neural networks' performance in various NLP tasks.
# More specifically, I apply Deep Learning methods in NLP tasks and enhance the performance by incorporating knowledge from both texts and graphs.
# I have also started my summer internship recently at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems under the supervision of <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Manuel Gomez Rodriguez</a>.
