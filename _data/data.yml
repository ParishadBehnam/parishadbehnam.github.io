    title: About Me
    summary: |
      My name is Parishad BehnamGhader. I got my B.Sc. degree at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran and I am currently a 2nd year master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the same university and a researcher in Machine Learning Lab in computer engineering department under the supervision of Prof. Mahdieh Soleymani.
      I have also started my summer internship recently at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems under the supervision of Prof. Manuel Gomez Rodriguez. I am mainly interested in Graph Representation Learning and Natural Language Processing. More specifically, I apply Deep Learning methods in NLP tasks and enhance the performance by incorporating knowledge from both texts and graphs.
