    title: About Me
    summary: |
      My name is Parishad BehnamGhader. I am currently a graduate student at the <a href="https://mcgill-nlp.github.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">McGill NLP research group</a> at McGill University and <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mila</a>, Montreal, Canada under <a href="https://sivareddy.in" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Siva Reddy</a>'s supervision. I got my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran and I was previously a researcher at <a href="http://mll.ce.sharif.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Learning Lab</a> in computer engineering department under the supervision of <a href="http://sharif.edu/~soleymani/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Mahdieh Soleymani</a>.
      I am mainly interested in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. More specifically, I am currently working on the reasoning ability of retriever-based large language models.
# I currently take advantage of the real-world information of knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance deep neural networks' performance in various NLP tasks.
# More specifically, I apply Deep Learning methods in NLP tasks and enhance the performance by incorporating knowledge from both texts and graphs.
# I have also started my summer internship recently at Max Planck Institute for Software Systems under the supervision of <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~manuelgr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prof. Manuel Gomez Rodriguez</a>.
